Code Samples Related to Recent Research


This repository contains two representative code samples that demonstrate the computational and modeling aspects of my recent academic work in cosmology.  
They highlight my experience in large-scale structure modeling, Bayesian parameter inference, and high-performance computing.




1. TNG_fit_CHIME.ipynb


Description: 
This Jupyter notebook performs an MCMC-based parameter inference to fit a theoretical 21 cm power-spectrum model to the neutral hydrogen (HI) power spectrum extracted from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations.


Purpose:
To validate that our analytical 21 cm power-spectrum model exhibits realistic behavior over the wavenumber ranges probed by the CHIME intensity-mapping experiment.  
By comparing with IllustrisTNG outputs, we ensure that the modeled scale dependence and amplitude evolution are physically consistent with galaxy formation physics encoded in state-of-the-art simulations.


Key Features:
- Loads H I power-spectrum data from IllustrisTNG snapshots.  
- Implements modeling of redshift-space distortions and nonlinear damping.  
- Runs Bayesian parameter inference using MCMC sampling.  
- Produces posterior distributions, best-fit parameters, and diagnostic plots.




2. CUDA_dark_energy_inference.cu


Description: 
A CUDA C code designed for cosmological parameter inference in extended ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) models.  
It uses GPU acceleration to efficiently compute theoretical predictions and likelihoods for cosmological observables.


Purpose:
To perform fast, parallelized parameter estimation using Cosmic Chronometer, Supernova Ia (SN), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) datasets.  
This framework explores dark-energy parameter spaces beyond ΛCDM using high-performance computing techniques.




Key Features:
- GPU-accelerated likelihood evaluation and model computation using CUDA kernels.  
- Incorporates datasets from cosmic chronometers, SNe Ia, and BAO measurements.  

- Performs χ² minimization and parameter-space sampling for cosmological models with interacting or evolving dark energy.
